# How many shells project

## Objective 

How many shells project is aimed to gain unauthorized shell access to the Ubuntu machine by exploiting vulnerabilties in order to be able to execute commands, along with privilege escalation and it also is demonstrating the risks and how easy it is to exploit a system that is not properly patched. 

### Skills Learned 

- Advanced knowledge of exploiting machines
- Ability to generate payloads and run network scans
- Proficiency in executing proper shell commands to gain access

### Tools Used  

- Explotation Frameworks such as Metasploit ( more specifically MSFvenom) in order to gain access to machines and set payloads 
- Scanning and Enumeration tools (Nmap, Netcat) for capturing and examining network traffic 
- Virtual machine (ubuntu machine) which was the machine we were exploiting
